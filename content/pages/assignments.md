The assignments in this class consist of a major analytic term paper, produced in stages during the term, plus a few discrete problem sets.

The epidemiological data and analysis program found in the {{% resource_link 353224f8-5912-24e2-f273-59c0aa56b239 "Tools" %}} page is used extensively in these assignments.

Term Paper
----------

Each student chooses a common disease such as a form of cancer, vascular disease or diabetes of interest to him or her. Every three weeks a "chapter" is due in draft form with references developed in parallel with material from class that uses colon and lung cancer as principle examples. A "chapter" would be on the order of four-five pages of discussion of the key facts about the chosen disease.
