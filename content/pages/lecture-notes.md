(b) Environmental epidemiology and community risk.   
(c) Population genetics and familial risk.   
(d) Human physiology and genetics.

2\. Common theoretical structures:

(a) Clonal expansion models: carcinogenesis and atherogenesis   
(b) Cell/function mortality models: diabetes, neural degenerative diseases

(b) Use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis to discover significant differences between observed and expected distributions of mortality rates distributed over all communities.

Hypotheses that need testing. (Professor turns 60 and looks to future.)

1. Point mutation and chromosomal translocation mutations that initiate preneoplasia are restricted to years prior to metamorphosis to adult form in humans.

2. DNA turnover in human stem and transitional cells involves a significant fraction of DNA each day.

3. Point mutations in tissues are primarily generated by DNA polymerase errors during DNA synthesis and re-synthesis during DNA turnover in pre-adult stem cells.

4. Environmental risk factors accelerate growth of preneoplastic lesions that arose in juvenile years.

5. Environmental risk factors induce organ-specific inflammation.

6. Genetic risks for common diseases are multi-allelic and commonly monogenic.
